# Overview

CypherSyntax is an educational project that aims to nurture potential Gnolang developers by offering structured learning material in the form of detailed articles, providing a self-paced learning experience in a beginner-friendly manner.

Here's the step-by-step curriculum we'll follow to create the best Gnolang learning hub:–

__1. Introduction to Gnoland:__ Understanding the philosophy, mission, and architecture of the Gnoland blockchain.

__2. Gnolang Overview:__ Exploring how Gnolang aims to revolutionize smart contracts development by making everything open source.

__3. Gnolang vs Golang:__ Understanding the key differences between Gno and Go by an in-depth comparison between the two languages.

__4. Gno Development Setup:__ Learning how to setup development environment and using all the necessary developer tools, including Gnodev and Gnokey to start writing Gno code.

__5. Data Types:__ Learning the fundamental data types in Gno, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, runes, and pointers.

__6. Basic Syntax:__ Mastering the basic building blocks of Gno program, including package declarations, import statements, variables, constants, operators, and comments.

__7. Control Structures:__ Managing the flow of execution in Gno program through conditionals, statements, and loops.

__8. Functions and Methods:__ Understanding how to define and use functions in Gno, as well as exploring methods-functions associated with specific types.

__9. Data Structures:__ Learning how to define, use, and manipulate the core data structures in Gno, including arrays, slices, structs, and maps.

__10. Interfaces and Polymorphism:__ Understanding how to define and use interfaces in Gno to specify sets of method signatures, as well as polymorphism.

__11. Error Handling:__ Exploring techniques such as explicit error checking, creating custom error types, wrapping errors, to handle errors in Gno program.

__12. Packages and Imports:__ Understanding how to organize Gno code into packages of related source files and how to use the import statement to include external packages in Gno programs.

__13. Standard Gno libraries:__ Exploring the comprehensive collection of libraries bundled with Gno, to leverage these well-tested packages for building powerful Dapps.

__14. Realm Development:__ Learning how to craft structured realms from scratch using Gnolang.

__15. State Management:__ Understanding how to manage persistent and in-memory state in Gno realms.

__16. Events and Messaging:__ Exploring how events and messaging enable realms in Gno to communicate and react to important changes or actions.

__17. Testing and Debugging:__ Learning how to ensure the reliability and correctness of your Gnolang code by writing and running tests using Gno’s built-in tools like Gno Test and Gno Debugger.

__18. Realm Deployment:__ Learning how to deploy Realm to the Gnoland blockchain using two main approaches: the Gno Playground and Gnokey CLI tool.

__19. Gnoweb Exploration:__

__20. Working with External Systems:__

__21. Gas Fees and Optimization Techniques:__

__22. Performance and Security Optimization:__

__23. Upgradability and Governance:__

__24. Building Projects with Gno:__
