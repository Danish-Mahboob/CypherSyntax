# Introduction
Hello Everyone! My name is Danish and I'm an aspiring Blockchain Developer, who is very passionate about Gnoland. I've been a part of the Blockchain Industry since 2023 and got introduced to the Cosmos Network in early 2024. I got to knew about Gnoland through Jae Kwon's Stanford Lecture in which he talked about things that I deeply resonated with and made me genuinely curious about the platform. So I started engaging with the Gnoland community and after understanding its Philosophy, I've figured out that Gnoland is the most suitable blockchain for me to start my journey.
