# Introduction
Hello Everyone! My name is Danish and I'm an aspiring Blockchain Developer, who is very passionate about Gnoland. I've been a part of the Blockchain space since 2023 and got introduced to the Cosmos Network in early 2024. I got to knew about Gnoland through Jae Kwon's Stanford Lecture in which he talked about things that I deeply resonated with and made me genuinely curious about the platform. So I started engaging with the Gnoland community and after understanding its Philosophy, I've figured out that Gnoland is the most suitable blockchain for me to start my journey.

# Objective
The goal of this repository is to create a foundation for my work.

Over the next 6-12 months I will be writing comprehensive articles about how can an absolute beginner start his/her blockchain journey from scratch, the basics of Gnoland's core componentsc and I'll also document my journey of becoming a Gnolang Developer and deploying complex smart contracts in a beginner friendly way.

These articles will be completely open source, which means anyone can access these articles for free and can use it anywhere you want without caring about copyright issues.
