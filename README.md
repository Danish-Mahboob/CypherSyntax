# Introduction
Hello Gnomes! Welcome to Gnodium, a developer oriented project which aims to provide all the technical resources and information anyone would need to become a Gnoland Developer. From the fundamentals of programming to the basics of Blockchain, we will cover everything and to make it easily discoverable and accessible to passionate people we will provide the content in the form of multiple well structured series of comprehensive articles on multiple blogging platforms such as Hashnode and Medium, as these articles will attract developers interested in Gnoland and over time, we aim to build a vibrant community of people who are eager to build cool stuff on the Gnoland Blockchain.

# Roadmap

*Note*: This project is going to be completely open source and free to use without any copyright issues.
