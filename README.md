# Overview

CypherSyntax is an educational project that aims to nurture potential Gnolang developers by offering structured learning material in the form of detailed articles, providing a self-paced learning experience in a beginner-friendly manner.

Here's the step-by-step curriculum we'll follow to create the best Gnolang learning hub:â€“

__1. Introduction to Gnoland:__ Understanding the philosophy, mission, and architecture of the Gnoland blockchain.

__2. Gnolang Overview:__ Exploring how Gnolang aims to revolutionize smart contracts development by making everything open source.

__3. Gnolang vs Golang:__ Understanding the key differences between Gno and Go by an in-depth comparison between the two languages.

__4. Gno Development Setup:__ Learning how to setup development environment and using all the necessary developer tools, including Gnodev and Gnokey to start writing Gno code.
